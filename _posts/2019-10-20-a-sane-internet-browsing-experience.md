## The problem

Distraction have been a problem in my life since always. I used to design my work and studying environment so hard on limiting I even got to a point where I'd disassemble my desktop computer (the only source of internet access) and put it in a wardrobe to impose myself a 10 minutes assembly session if I really want to use it.

Years later things got harder after internet become available at every corner and programming become one of my working tools.

But even when not thinking about work and getting things done, consuming internet for entertainment become a extremely passively distracted, noisy and mentally disordering activity - too much content, ads and recommendations.

At some point I realized I'd need a sane approach for using it and I've slowly found tools and settings to help me on that.

To achieve it, this guide aims to:

- identify the undesired behaviors
- limit your undesired behaviors
- minimize the amount of information displayed

So
## Identifying the undesired behaviors

So first of all you need to identify the specific behaviors you wouldn't like to keep. There are a few applications to measure how much time you spend in every website. This is probably going to be an unpleasant surprise, not because of which website, but about the time.

I've used [Mind the Time](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mind-the-time/) addon on Firefox to help me, but there are a lot of options for every browser.

This help me to realize how much time I was spending in activities I wouldn't say they were contributing to my happiness.

You can keep using it and not only as an initial motivation.

## Limiting
