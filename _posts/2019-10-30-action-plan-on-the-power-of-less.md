description: Action plan on simplyfing life
---

This is an action plan to simplify life and make it less stressful. follow `The Book of Less` from Leo Babauta. This is not necessarily how it's suggested in the book, but it's what I have designed from it to be useful for my case. If it sound vague, I'd recommend reading the book or a summary of it before.

As it might sound difficult to perform some of the activities here without kinda cheating or being able to truly eliminate things and focus on what is important, I recommend doing it together with another person. Many items, specially the lists, are shortened versions from the book or exact extractions, but they won't be quoted.

## Introduction

## Goals and values

At first, it's needed to identify what is going to move you on.

1. What are your values?
2. What are your goals? What do you want to achieve in life in many time ranges: a week, month, n months, year and so, split it by any range you feel makes sense to you.
3. What do you love? List activities.
3. Who do you love? List people you care about.
4. What is important to you?
5. What has the biggest impact? From all your goals, projects and tasks, which  will make the biggest difference in your life or career?
6. What has the most long-term impact?
7. Needs vs. wants. Which items do you actually need, and which ones are just things you want?

Ok, so at the end we have a list of values, goals, activities and people. It's time to elimination. It's usually easier to work backward, trying to get rid of what is nonessential.

Be aware of our trend to think we're special and different and you can deal with multiple focus (a thing that doesn't even make sense in itself), values and goals. If after elimination you end up with a lot of things, try ordering them. Then look to the top 3 and wonder if succeeding on them would be enough to make you happy - go with the minimum enough to make it.

Remember it's a continual editing process.

## Identifying everything you're putting your life into

Ok, so now it's time to list everything you're involved. From work, personal projects, social and so on.

## Limiting
### Goals

Follow this order:

1. General goals (whatever time it takes to be accomplished)
2. Ask yourself: Does it make sense considering my values?
3. Make it a 6-12 months goal
4. Create sub-goals using SMART goals framework
5. Break it in tasks
6. When performing it, break it in week goals and daily action

### Projects

Get your list of projects and reduce it to **three projects at most**. This is what you're going to work on.

### Commitments

First, make the inventory of all your current commits, professional, personal projects and personal life.

Then clean some of them.

- Does it match the values I pursue?
- How important is it to me?
- Is it in line with my life priorities and values?
- How would it affect my life if I dropped out?
- Does this further my life goals?

Whenever a person asks you something or send you an invite, follow the same criteria.

Don't see it as a selfish choice, first of all **there will be people who the propose matches their values and goals**, so you can route it if you know them or eventually the invite is going to find them.

Also, it may be included in your values helping other people under certain circumstances, but keep aware to help when your impact is meaningful, commitments mean your life time, so don't give it if you're not helping someone who needs it.

## Planning

### A new habit

- Pick a new habit
- Write down the plan
- Tell all your close friends you're going to pursue it
- Report progress daily
- Celebrate your new habit!

**Rules**:

- One a time
- Choose something easy to begin with
- Choose something measurable
- Be consistent, do at the same time everyday
-

### One goal system

From the list of goals you did at the beginning, choose **just one of them**.

#### Making goals into sub goals

Now you have one goal, break it down to sub goals.

#### Making projects into tasks

The sub goals won't be actionable yet. It's needed to break it into tasks. A sub goal may be something you would take a week or two, a month to complete. But a task is something you can do in a work-block. Consider the work block **you have available to work on**. If you just get 2 hour blocks to work, it's needed to break it into two-hour tasks.

#### Executing tasks

Each day you should choose as priority the task that will move you forward in your one goal. The practices to succeed on it are described in the `Everyday principles to work on`.

### Projects list

You also will  have other projects that may not be related to your one goal, since you have other areas in your life, like work. You should already have a list with the three you're going to work on. They won't leave this list until they are done and any project will get in until **all of them are done**.

#### Completion in mind

For every project in the list, you're going to define what does it mean to complete it. Be as clear as possible about what does it mean to succeed or to fail on it,  but put a finish line on it. You need to know where you want to be with it to help on its completion.

#### Break the project in tasks

Like the goals, it's needed to break it into tasks, the daily actionable parts of a project. This will help you to choose it to be done everyday and to get moving.

#### Reassess your progress

Be mindful about you completing the tasks. For doing so, reassess your progress daily and weekly, try to  identify if the tasks are moving you in the direction of the completion defined at the beginning.


## Everyday principles to work on

### Most Important Tasks

Everyday you're going to pick 1-3 MITs to complete. Pick at least one related to your **one goal at the time**. The other ones can be related to work projects.

### Single tasking

- Select the most important thing you need to do in that day (one of your MITs) and work on until as the first thing in the morning until you finish it;
- While working on it, turn off every distraction, like e-mail, phone and so on;
- Don't leave it until it's done! If you feel like you need to check anything else, just take a breath, but don't leave it;
- To anything that comes to your mind and it's not related to the task, take a note;
- If you really need to leave the task unfinished, make a personal note to remember you where exactly you were on it;
- Take breaks during the task: take a walk, stretch and so on.

### Get in the flow


- Choose a task you’re passionate about.
- Choose a task that’s challenging.
- Eliminate distractions.
- Immerse yourself in the task. Just start on the task, and focus completely on it.

### Do the small tasks in batch

Things you seem to need to interrupt your MITs, don't let it happen. Write down all the small tasks in a list and do them in batch, in a certain time block and **after completing your MITs for that day**.

So e-mails, meetings, apartment related stuff, bureaucracy and so on. Don't let it spread in your day.

## Simplifying

### Routines

Find a couple of activities to fill your morning in a regular and calming routine, like taking bath, exercise, having breakfast and reading. The same goes for evening.

### Tools

Don't go crazy into productivity tools. If you need too many things to get organized it's because you haven't simplified and limited your life enough, so go back to the **limiting** part.

### Notifications and mobile

Go to the `notifications` panel in your mobile and block most of them. Don't let it dictate your work flow and mind state. It's important to reduce the phone usage, for doing so:

1. When working, put it in your pocket or don't let it at your view;
2. Make it simpler:
    1. Delete unused apps
	2. Delete apps used excessively, but they don't contribute for well being
	3. Delete unused widgets
	4. Create folders for apps to make it cleaner

### E-mail

1. Start by cleaning your inbox, but do it while doing the `2`!
2. While cleaning it, create filters to avoid that kind of e-mail going into your inbox
3. Approach e-mail daily with the mission of archive every read e-mail. If it generates an action that can't be done at that time, put it into your list of batch activities to do later, then archive it.

### Internet

1. Awareness: use an application to measure how much time you spend in every website;
2. You may identify some websites you spend a lot of time and don't contribute to your well being. These are the ones you would like to limit the access or block entirely. But also identify the ones you really need to work.
3. Block the unnecessary to your life. It's different than blocking all fun, they are just junk applications that don't even make you relax.
4. Reduce the usage of entertainment sites **if they are taking more time than you think it's reasonable**. No need to create a rule for something that is not a problem yet.
5. Simplify the websites you need to use to get your work done.

Here's a more [detailed guide about it]().

### Work space

Get rid of everything you have on your work table that is not essential to perform the task at hand.
