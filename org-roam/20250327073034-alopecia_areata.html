Larow, Jo Anne And Mysliborski, Judith And Rappaport, I. Paul And Rouleau, Guy A. And Carlson, J. Andrew (2001) studies a single case. They highlight that the diagnostic needs to exclude the case of <a href="#org3526e47">Clouston syndrome</a>.

Pediatric alopecia areata affects 1 in every 1000 (<a href="https://www.naaf.org/alopecia-areata-in-children/">source</a>, Mckenzie, Paige L. And Maltenfort, Mitchell And Bruckner, Anna L.

48% of teens are embarrassed about their hair loss.
7% said that their hair loss affected their friendships.
59% said that they have been stared at or people have talked about them.
52% said that their hair loss made them limit their activities.

<p>
According to Khan Mohammad Beigi, Pooya (2018), less than 10% of the patients with <a href="20250327073034-alopecia_areata.html#ID-AEE61F0D-8EEB-4535-A2C3-AB60FE3A48B7">Alopecia Areata</a> Universalis recover.

Systemic steroids might not be a good idea for AU (C. Stefanaki And G. Kontochristopoulos And E. Hatzidimitraki And A. Stergiopoulou And A. Katsarou And V. Vosynioti And E. Remountaki And D. Rigopoulos (2021)):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Apart from systemic steroids for a short period of time (6 weeks), no other systemic agents were tried in our study and those were reserved for severe cases. However, 2/5 of the children treated with systemic steroids did not have a cosmetically acceptable hair regrowth in a 3-month follow-up. Both had alopecia totalis. Patients with AA have been found to respond better to systemic steroids than patients with alopecia totalis, and a 60% response rate has been reported [9, 24, 25, 26] but most fail to maintain a sustainable result.

<p>
Patientsd younger than 4 have poor prognosis, but better treatment response (to topical corticosteroids) Lim, Ji-Hoon And Kwon, Soon-Hyo And Sim, Woo-Young And Lew, Bark-Lynn (2024). The <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/exd.14991">article</a> has many results for the treatment in young patients.

Advantan (aceponato de metilprednisolona / methylprednisolone aceponate). It should exceed 4 weeks of treatment.
</p>

<p>
A short application period typicall goes from 2-4 weeks. There are risks of applying it, like making the skin thinner and getting corticosteroids into the blood stream. There are side effects like compromising the cortisol or delaying growth (for children).
</p>

<p>
Efficacy, from Friedli, A. And Labarthe, M. P. And Engelhardt, E. And Feldmann, R. And Salomon, D. And Saurat, J. H. (1998):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In patients with universalis and totalis AA (n = 15), no total regrowth was observed initially; 8 patients had no response, and 3 showed 50% to 90% regrowth at I month, with subsequent improvement at 3 and 6 months. In 4 patients who did not show an initial response, a significant (90% to 100%) delayed regrowth was observed between 9 and 16 months after the pulse therapy.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From Assouly, P. And Reygagne, P. And Jouanique, C. And Matard, B. And Marechal, E. And Reynert, P. And Bachelez, H. And Dubertret, L. (2003):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Results: Ophiasic alopecia areata did not respond to treatment. A quarter of patients presenting universal alopecia had a good response (higher than 80 p. 100) followed by a relapse in half the cases. Half of the patients presenting alopecia totalis had a good response, which was maintained three times out of four. Multifocal alopecia areata seems the best indication since the patients under study presented a good response in 63.8 p. 100 of cases (78 p. 100 when it was a first episode and 90.5 p. 100 if the treatment had been started in less than 3 months before). The repetition of the pulses did not appear to increase the number of responders.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From Nakajima, T. And Inui, S. And Itami, S. (2007):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Method: A total of 139 severe AA patients aged &gt;15 years were included in this study. The duration from the onset of active hair loss was within 12 months for 125 (89.9%) of those patients.
</p>

<p>
Results: Of the patients, 72.7% had hair loss on &gt; 50% of their scalp area. Among the recent-onset group (duration of AA &lt; or = 6 months), 59.4% were good responders (&gt; 75% regrowth of alopecia lesions), while 15.8% with &gt; 6 months duration showed a good response. Recent-onset AA patients with less severe disease (&lt; or = 50% hair loss) responded at a rate of 88.0%, but only 21.4% of recent-onset patients with 100% hair loss responded. No serious adverse effects were observed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Im, M. And Lee, S. S. And Lee, Y. And Kim, C. D. And Seo, Y. J. And Lee, J. H. And Park, J. K. (2011) shows the same factors affecting the efficiency: the less severe the case, the better the chances; the shorter the time between the onset, the better the chance.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The prognostic factors that influenced successful outcome were the disease duration before treatment and the type of alopecia areata. Based on these two factors, a good response was obtained for all types of alopecia areata with a duration of 3months or less before treatment and for the plurifocal type of alopecia areata with a duration of 4-6months. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy is indicated for those alopecia areata patients who fall within our good response group.

<p>
According to S{\'a}Nchez-D{\'i}Az, M And Montero-Vilchez, T And Bueno-Rodriguez, A And Molina-Leyva, A And Arias-Santiago, S (2022), the early onset and hypothyroidism comorbidity decreases the chances of oral corticosteroids pulses (dexamethasone) to be effective:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
An overall significant and progressive decrease of the SALT score was found during treatment: SALT-50 response was achieved after 9 months in 51.8% of the patients. Hypothyroidism and early age of onset were predictors of the lack of response to treatment. The treatment combination with oral minoxidil showed no effect on the SALT score reduction. Dexamethasone daily and cumulative dose were associated with a higher percentage of side effects. To conclude, the mini-pulse oral corticosteroids treatment is an effective treatment for AA, although patients with an early onset of the disease and hypothyroidism may not benefit

Shorter time from onset to treatment also appears here as a positive factor for response:

Results: Of 32 patients, 26 (81.3%) reported a clinical response. Four patients (12.5%) showed complete hair regrowth, 6 patients (18.8%) showed &gt;50% hair regrowth, ten (31.3%) had &lt;50% hair regrowth, 6 (18.75%) were non responders, and another 6 patients (18.8%) had relapse after an initial regrowth. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients reporting at the first episode and those with multifocal disease had the best results.

<p>
Their results:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Results: The sample included 24 children (16 female, 8 male) with a mean age of 8.5 ± 4.6 years at diagnosis; 8 (33%) had multifocal disease,10 (42%) multifocal disease with ophiasis, 4 (17%) alopecia totalis and 2 (8%) alopecia universalis. Nail involvement was noted in 9 patients (38%). Mean duration of disease was 22 ± 27 months. Patients were treated with 8 mg/kg body weight intravenous methylprednisolone on 3 consecutive days at 1-month intervals. After a mean of 5.65 ± 1.95 courses, 9 patients (38%) had a complete response, 7 (29%) a partial response and 8 (33%) no response. Of the 16 responders, 13 (81%) relapsed at 9.5 ± 12 months after the last course; 3 patients had side effects, none of which were severe.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Topical irritants, topical immunotherapy
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b><b>Contact immunotherapy</b></b> is a medical treatment that involves the application of an irritant substance (often a chemical) to the skin to stimulate the immune system. It is typically used to treat certain skin conditions, particularly <b><b>alopecia areata</b></b>, a form of hair loss where the immune system attacks hair follicles.
</p>

<p>
In the context of <b><b>alopecia areata</b></b>, <b><b>contact immunotherapy</b></b> works by provoking a mild allergic reaction on the skin, which in turn triggers an immune response that can alter the activity of the immune system. This immune response may help to stop the immune system from attacking the hair follicles, allowing for hair regrowth.
</p>

<p>
### How it Works:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A chemical agent, such as <b><b>diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP)</b></b> or <b><b>squaric acid dibutylester (SADBE)</b></b>, is applied to the affected area of the skin.</li>
<li>The chemical causes a controlled allergic reaction (contact dermatitis), which is a mild inflammatory response.</li>
<li>The idea is that the immune system, in responding to this reaction, will shift its focus away from attacking the hair follicles, potentially allowing hair to grow back.</li>
</ul>

<p>
### Effectiveness:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Contact immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in some patients with <b><b>alopecia areata</b></b>, leading to regrowth of hair. However, the treatment doesn’t work for everyone, and it may take several months to see results.</li>
<li>It is not a permanent cure, and hair may fall out again once the treatment is stopped.</li>
</ul>

<p>
### Risks and Side Effects:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The treatment can cause side effects like itching, redness, and swelling in the area where the chemical was applied.</li>
<li>There is a risk of more severe allergic reactions, but these are rare when the procedure is done under medical supervision.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In summary, contact immunotherapy is a treatment aimed at stimulating the immune system in a controlled way to encourage hair regrowth, particularly for conditions like alopecia areata. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness and safety of the treatment should be assessed by a healthcare provider.

Is it safe for children? Hamilton, Claire E. And Others (2021):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Phase 1 studies of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of malignancy and inflammatory conditions in children have supported the potential safety of these medications and have provided dosing guidance. Randomized controlled trials in children with AA are ultimately needed to fully establish the efficacy and safety of this drug class for this patient population.

More <a href="https://www.naaf.org/available-treatments-2/">resources</a>.
</p>

<p>
They target the immune pathway that is responsible for hair loss in AA.
Don't cause hair grow, but go after the immune cells preventint it.
</p>

<p>
The JAK are proteins that send messages. So when the immune cells blocking the hair follicle need to be replaced, their message to send more immune cells there won't be received and it won't block it anymore.
</p>

<p>
We need to block first the inflammation, then a hair needs to grow, that's why it takes a couple of months.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
JAK inhibitors carry a risk of infection as a side effect. Tofacitinib can be used to treat patients for other conditions beyond alopecia areata. When tofacitinib has been used in some of these contexts (for example, to treat people with rheumatoid arthritis), it has been linked with higher rates of heart-related events, cancers, blood clots and serious infections. Although it is very unclear whether people treated with tofacitinib or other JAK inhibitors for AA will also be at elevated risk of these conditions, the regulatory authorities have nevertheless issued a ‘box warning’ for doctors and patients to be cautious when using JAK inhibitors for any condition.
