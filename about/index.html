	Hi, my name is Luis Moneda, I'm a computer engineer and economist. I've obtained my degrees from University of Sao Paulo.

	I work as a Data Scientist at Nubank. 
	
	I'm interested in Machine Learning, Microeconomics, Econometrics and other related areas. I hope I can write about these subjects here!
